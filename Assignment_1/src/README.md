Java Multithreading — Race Condition
This project demonstrates a race condition in Java multithreading and two common ways to solve it:

synchronized
AtomicInteger
📌 Concept
Three threads share a single counter. Each thread increments the counter 100,000 times.

Number of threads = 3
Increments per thread = 100,000

Expected count = 3 × 100,000
               = 300,000
🔴 Race Condition
The following operation is not thread-safe:

count++;
Although it looks like one operation, it involves reading, modifying, and writing the value.

When multiple threads execute it concurrently, some increments may be lost.

Example:

Expected count = 300000
Actual count   = 247831
The actual result can vary between executions.

🟢 Solution 1 — synchronized
The increment() method can be synchronized:

static synchronized void increment() {
    count++;
}
This ensures that only one thread at a time can execute the method.

M1.java
public class M1 extends Thread {

    static int count = 0;

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            increment();
        }
    }

    static synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}
Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

        M1 t1 = new M1();
        M1 t2 = new M1();
        M1 t3 = new M1();

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();
        t3.join();

        System.out.println("Expected count = " + 300000);
        System.out.println("Actual count = " + M1.count);
    }
}
Result
Expected count = 300000
Actual count = 300000
🟢 Solution 2 — AtomicInteger
Java provides AtomicInteger for thread-safe operations on integers.

Instead of:

static int count = 0;
we use:

static AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
And instead of:

count++;
we use:

count.incrementAndGet();
M1.java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class M1 extends Thread {

    static AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            count.incrementAndGet();
        }
    }
}
Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

        M1 t1 = new M1();
        M1 t2 = new M1();
        M1 t3 = new M1();

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();
        t3.join();

        System.out.println("Expected count = " + 300000);
        System.out.println("Actual count = " + M1.count.get());
    }
}
Result
Expected count = 300000
Actual count = 300000
🔍 Important Methods
start()
Starts a thread and causes its run() method to execute.

t1.start();
join()
Makes the main thread wait until the specified thread finishes.

t1.join();
join() does not solve the race condition. It only ensures that the threads have finished before we print the final result.

synchronized
Allows only one thread at a time to execute the synchronized method.

static synchronized void increment()
AtomicInteger
Provides thread-safe operations on an integer.

count.incrementAndGet();
To retrieve the current value:

count.get();
⚖️ synchronized vs AtomicInteger
Feature	synchronized	AtomicInteger
Thread-safe	✅	✅
Prevents race condition	✅	✅
Uses locking	✅	❌
Good for simple counters	✅	✅
Increment operation	count++ inside synchronized block	incrementAndGet()
Easy to understand	✅	✅
🧠 Key Takeaways
Multiple threads accessing shared data can cause a race condition.
count++ is not atomic.
join() waits for threads to finish but does not prevent race conditions.
synchronized provides mutual exclusion using a lock.
AtomicInteger provides atomic operations without explicitly using synchronized.
Both approaches can safely produce the expected result of 300000.
Important distinction
join()
  ↓
Wait for thread to finish

synchronized
  ↓
Allow only one thread at a time

AtomicInteger
  ↓
Perform integer operations atomically
